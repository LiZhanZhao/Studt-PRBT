Shapes to be rendered directly are represented by the GeometricPrimitive class. This class
combines a Shape with a description of its appearance properties. So that the geometric
and shading portions of pbrt can be cleanly separated, these appearance properties are
encapsulated in the Material class.

The GeometricPrimitive class represents a single shape (e.g., a sphere) in the scene. One
GeometricPrimitive is allocated for each shape in the scene description provided by the
user.

Each GeometricPrimitive holds a reference to a Shape and its Material. In addition,
because primitives in pbrt may be area light sources, it stores a pointer to an AreaLight
object that describes its emission characteristics

The TransformedPrimitive class handles two more general uses of Shapes in the scene:
shapes with animated transformation matrices and object instancing, which can greatly
reduce the memory requirements for scenes that contain many instances of the same
geometry at different locations.
Implementing each of
these features essentially requires injecting an additional transformation matrix between
the Shape’s notion of world space and the actual scene world space. Therefore, both are
handled by a single class

the Aggregate base class, which represents a container that
can hold many Primitives. pbrt uses this class to implement acceleration structures―
data structures that help reduce the otherwise O(n) complexity of testing a ray for
intersection with all n objects in a scene. Most rays will intersect only a few primitives
and miss the others by a large distance.If an intersection acceleration technique can reject(拒绝)
whole groups of primitives at once, there will be a substantial(实质) performance improvement
compared to simply testing each ray against each primitive in turn. One benefit from
reusing the Primitive interface for these acceleration structures is that pbrt can support
hybrid(混合) approaches where an accelerator of one type holds accelerators of other types.
