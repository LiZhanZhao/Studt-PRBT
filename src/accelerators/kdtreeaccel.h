/*
KdTreeAccel) based on adaptive(自适应) recursive(递归) spatial subdivision(空间细分).

Binary space partitioning (BSP) trees adaptively(自适应) subdivide space into irregularly(不规则) sized
regions. The most important consequence(结论) of this difference with regular grids is that they
can be a much more effective data structure for storing irregularly distributed collections
of geometry. A BSP tree starts with a bounding box that encompasses(包围) the entire scene.
If the number of primitives in the box is greater than some threshold(阈值), the box is split
in half by a plane. Primitives are then associated with whichever half they overlap and
primitives that lie in both halves are associated with both of them.

The splitting process continues recursively either until each leaf region in the resulting
tree contains a sufficiently small number of primitives or until a maximum depth is
reached. Because the splitting planes can be placed at arbitrary positions inside the overall
bound and because different parts of 3D space can be refined to different degrees, BSP
trees can easily handle uneven(不均匀) distributions of geometry.

Two variations of BSP trees are kd-trees and octrees. A kd-tree simply restricts the splitting
plane to be perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes; this makes both traversal and
construction of the tree more efficient, at the cost of some flexibility in how space is
subdivided.
