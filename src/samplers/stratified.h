/*
The first sample generator that we will introduce divides the image plane into rectangular
regions and generates a single sample inside each region. These regions are commonly
called strata(层).

The key idea behind
stratification(层化) is that by subdividing(细分) the sampling domain into nonoverlapping regions
and taking a single sample from each one, we are less likely to(不太可能) miss important features
of the image entirely, since the samples are guaranteed(保证) not to all be close together. Put
another way(另一种方式), it does us no good(这对我们没有好处) if many samples are taken from nearby points in the
sample space, since each new sample doesn’t add much new information about the
behavior of the image function

The stratified sampler places each sample at a random point inside each stratum by
jittering the center point of the stratum by a random amount up to(直到) half the stratum’s
width and height. The nonuniformity(不平均) that results from this jittering helps turn aliasing
into noise,

The sampler also offers a nonjittered mode, which
gives uniform(均匀) sampling in the strata; this mode is mostly useful for comparisons between
different sampling techniques rather than for rendering final images
